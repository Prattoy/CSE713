1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Collect a dataset of handwritten signature images, including both genuine and forged signatures.
   - Preprocess the signature images by resizing, normalizing, and enhancing the image quality if necessary.

2. Data Split:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Ensure that the distribution of genuine and forged signatures is balanced across the splits.

3. Siamese Network Architecture:
   - Design the siamese network architecture, incorporating convolutional layers for feature extraction and similarity metrics for signature comparison.
   - Train the siamese network using pairs of genuine and forged signature samples, using suitable loss functions such as contrastive loss or triplet loss.

4. Transformer Architecture:
   - Design the transformer architecture, which focuses on capturing long-range dependencies and modeling sequential data.
   - Train the transformer network using the signature images, considering both genuine and forged signatures as input.

5. Hybrid Model Integration:
   - Combine the trained siamese network and transformer network to form the hybrid model.
   - Define the mechanism for fusing the outputs of the siamese network and transformer network for final decision-making.

6. SHAP XAI Integration:
   - Implement SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) XAI techniques to explain the hybrid model's predictions.
   - Utilize SHAP values to quantify the contribution of each input feature (e.g., pixels, strokes) to the model's decision, providing interpretability and transparency.

7. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the performance of the hybrid model on the testing set, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Analyze the SHAP explanations to gain insights into how the model arrives at its decisions and identify important features in the signature verification process.

8. Model Optimization and Iteration:
   - Fine-tune the hybrid model, siamese network, and transformer network based on the evaluation results.
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning, architectural modifications, or additional techniques to improve the model's performance and interpretability.

9. Deployment and Application:
   - Deploy the trained hybrid model in a real-world application for offline handwritten signature verification.
   - Ensure proper integration with user interfaces and data handling mechanisms.
   - Continuously monitor and evaluate the model's performance in production, making necessary updates or improvements as needed.

Throughout the work plan, it's important to document your steps, conduct thorough experimentation, and iterate based on the evaluation results. Regularly validate and refine the model to ensure its effectiveness in verifying handwritten signatures.
